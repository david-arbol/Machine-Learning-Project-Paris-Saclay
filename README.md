# Machine-Learning-Project-Paris-Saclay
Final Project of the course Machine Learning at the University Paris-Saclay as part of the Erasmus Mundus Master's. 
A multi-layered feed-forward neural network was constructed to accurately reproduce the ground wave function of a charged particle under an electric field.

Program. Language: Python3, using sklearn. I use my own multi-layered feed-forward neural network code and Pytorch and compare. 

1. Provide the energy of interaction between the charged particle and the electric field $E_{field}$.

2. Use the python3 code developed during the tutorial sessions to compute the eigen-states of the particle. Report the associated energy values and plot the wave functions.

3. Compute the expected values of x, of the Hamiltonian H, of the momentum p. Compare (and plot) these values with the ones obtained by a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator without perturbation.
        
4. Construct a multi-layered feed-forward neural network NNÎ¸ capable to reproduce the wave functions computed for question 2.
